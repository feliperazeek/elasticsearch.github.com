                add search to it, and then it hits us: <b>getting

                Search Engines data model roots lies with schema free
                and document oriented databases, and as shown by the

                elasticsearch model is <a href=

                the de-facto standard for representing data these
                days. More over, with JSON, it is simple to provide
                semi-structured data with complex entities as well as
                being programming language natural with first level
                parsers.

            <p>
                elasticsearch is schema less, just toss it a typed
                JSON document and it will automatically index it.
                Types such as numbers and dates are automatically
                detected and treated accordingly.

            <p>
                But, as we all know, Search Engines are quite
                sophisticated. Fields in documents can have boost
                levels that affect scoring, analyzers can be used to
                control how text gets tokenized into terms, certain
                fields should not be analyzed at all, and so on... .
                elasticsearch allows you to completely control how a JSON
                document gets mapped into the search engine on a per
                type and per index level.

                Indexing data is always done using a unique
                identifier (at the type level). This is very handy
                since many times we wish to update or delete the
                actual indexed data, or just GET it. Getting data
                could not be simpler and all that is needed is the index
                name, the type and the id. What we get back is the
                <b>actual JSON document</b> used to index the
                specific data, but please, keep it secret and don't

                simpler. Issuing queries is a simple call hiding
                away the sophisticated distributed based search
                support elasticsearch provides. Search can be

                A single index is already a major step forward,
                but what happens when we need to have more than
                one index. There are many cases for using
                multiple indices, an example can be storing an
                index per week of log files indexing, or even
                having different indices with different settings
                (one with memory storage, and one with file

                The ability to configure is a double edged
                sword. We want the ability to start working
                with the system as fast as possible, with no

                almost every aspect of the application if

            <p>
                <strong>elasticsearch</strong> is built with
                this notion in mind. Almost everything is

                <b>each index can have its own settings</b>

                which can override the master settings. For
                example, one index can be configured with
                memory storage and have 10 shards with 1
                replica each, and another index can have file
                based storage with 1 shard and 10 replicas.
                All the index level settings can be
                controlled when creating an index either
                using a YAML or JSON format.

                One of the main features of Elastic Search is
                its distributed nature. Indices are broken
                down into shards, each shard with 0 or more
                replicas. Each data node within the cluster
                hosts one or more shards, and acts as a
                coordinator to delegate operations to the
                correct shard(s). Rebalancing and routing are
                done <b>automatically and behind the
                scenes</b>.

            <p>
                Sometimes the whole cluster crashes or needs
                to be taken down. Many times, in such a case,
                we want to restore to the latest state of the
                cluster when it comes back up again.
                elasticsearch provides the gateway module
                allowing you to do just that, think <b>Time
                Machine for search</b>.
            </p>

            <p>
                The state of the cluster (including the
                transaction log) can either be recreated from
                each node local storage (the default), or
                from a shared storage (like NFS or Amazon
                S3). When using shared storage, the state
                is <b>asynchronously</b> replicated to it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Moreover, when using shared storage for long term
                persistency, the index can be kept completely
                in memory while still being able to perform
                full recovery in the event of cluster
                shutdown.
